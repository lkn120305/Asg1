# BestReads Website

## Website live at:
https://lkn120305.github.io/Asg1/
## Objective
This is a book review website for users to read and write books
 
## Design Process

- As a user, I want to view the images of a couple of books on the home page, so I implemented the swiper.js function to showcase a couple of books in an organised way.
- As a user, I want to find the books I am looking for easily, so a search bar was added.
- As a user, I want to know the parts of the website that are clickable, so I added a hover effect and changed the cursor to a pointer for clickable buttons and text.
